# Gian Hackbarth - Data Analyst | BI Analyst | Operational Analyst

## About
Hello, i'm Gian! I am on track to completing my degree in Industrial Engineering (Bachelor). I have a developed a strong background in industrial operations, working in manufacturing industries like WEG S/A and Bunge S/A. My time at WEG as a eletrotechnical aprentice give me a strong knowledge in ladder programming using the WEG CLPs, automation projects and routine maintence. In Bunge, I helped with data analysis to support the wheat milling operations, working in the production analysis of the biggest mill in South America.

During my studies i developed my abilities in automate routine process, identifyng patterns and trends and develop strong process to support the process, adding new technologies when possible. 

This repository is a showcase of my skills, personal projects and having a track of my Data Analytics progress.

## Bunge S/A - Continuous Improvement Intern
During my tenure at the company, I led and developed methods to streamline the routines in the manufacturing areas. I assisted and trained team members in executing day-to-day tasks related to continuous improvement, including anomaly treatments, PDCA investigations, and implementation of the 5S Program. Additionally, I actively contributed to the development of a routine management application, which was subsequently deployed across other wheat plants within the company. Notably, this initiative achieved regional recognition in operational innovation programs.

My key responsibilities included:
* Problem Solving: Investigating production anomalies using tools such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerBI, and Minitab. I identified trends and sought solutions to prevent operational or maintenance disruptions.
* Solution Development: Creating the “GestãoPro” application, a Bunge-developed routine management tool. As the lead for implementing this app at the Ponta Grossa mill, I assessed coordinators’ and production areas’ needs, standardized operational procedures, and addressed challenges.
* Data Analysis: Analyzing the mill’s operational routines and generating reports for relevant stakeholders. This facilitated decision-making and communication between managers and supervisors. Additionally, I provided operational support during problem stratification, aiming to identify trends and anomalies.
